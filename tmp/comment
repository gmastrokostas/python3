â€‹ @Cece M  My comment is being deleted but here it is again.  This kind of stuff does nothing to help those in doubt to take the vaccine and the virus seriously. This is a clown show and makes the pandemic look like a silly thing which is not.

But then again, Americans these days are silly people. The world no longer takes Americans seriously.
